Illumination Rocket Navigation Through Genetic Algorithm

<div align="justify">

The provided code demonstrates a visualization of a genetic algorithm applied to a rocket simulation. The rockets aim to reach a green target while avoiding obstacles. The code utilizes the p5.js library to create a canvas and handle animation. The genetic algorithm is implemented through the DNA, Population, and Rocket classes. The DNA class represents the genetic material of each rocket, containing randomly generated vectors that determine their movement. The Population class manages a population of rockets, including evaluation, selection, and reproduction processes. The Rocket class defines the behavior of each rocket, including updating its position, calculating fitness, and displaying it on the canvas. The genetic algorithm works by evaluating the fitness of each rocket based on its proximity to the target, selecting the fittest rockets for reproduction, and generating a new population through crossover and mutation. Each generation of rockets improves its chances of reaching the target by inheriting favorable traits from the previous generation and introducing slight variations.By visualizing this genetic algorithm, the code showcases the ability of the rockets to learn and adapt over multiple generations, demonstrating an evolutionary process. It highlights the effectiveness of genetic algorithms in solving complex problems through iterative improvement.
